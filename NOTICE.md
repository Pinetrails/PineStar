# Third-party notices & credits

StarNet bundles a library of **pure-prompt skill recipes** (`sidecar/skills/library/*.md`).
Many are adaptations of MIT-licensed community skills. This file preserves the attribution
and license notices for that upstream work, as the MIT License requires. The recipe text in
the app is condensed and re-voiced for StarNet's workstation model, but the underlying ideas
and, in places, close paraphrases originate with the authors credited below.

Several recipes reached StarNet through the open-source **Hermes agent project**
(© 2025 Nous Research, MIT) — the harness StarNet's backend was in part ported from — which
had itself collected them from the community authors listed here. Credit is given to the
original authors wherever one is known.

## Ported from the Hermes agent project (© 2025 Nous Research, MIT)

These recipes were adapted from skills in the Hermes project's own library. Original
copyright holder: **Nous Research**.

`arxiv-research`, `code-review`, `codebase-inspection`, `domain-intel`, `excalidraw`,
`node-inspect-debugger`, `p5js-sketch`, `pdf-document-extraction` (from *ocr-and-documents*),
`python-debugger`, `simplify-code`, `web-research`.

## Authored for StarNet

These recipes were written for StarNet and carry no distinct external upstream. (They were
previously bylined "Hermes Agent" by convention; that byline has been removed.)

`adversarial-review-pass`, `announcement-kit`, `digest-composer`, `feed-watch`,
`ledger-upkeep`, `price-watch`, `security-sweep`, `source-triangulation`, `study-plan`,
`translation-pass`.

## Bundled fonts

StarNet ships the **VT323** typeface locally (`frontend/assets/fonts/vt323.woff2`) so the
CRT terminal look renders on an offline / air-gapped first boot without depending on Google
Fonts. VT323 is provided under the **SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1**.

- **Font:** VT323
- **Copyright:** © 2011 The VT323 Project Authors (peter.hull@oikoi.com)

The OFL permits bundling and redistribution of the font (including in an application) provided
the copyright and license notice above are preserved and the font itself is not sold on its
own. The full license text is available at the URL above; its permission notice reads, in
