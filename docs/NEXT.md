# NEXT.md — current priorities & task queue

**The one moving file.** Update it when you land or invalidate an item; don't write a new
plan doc. Reconciled against trunk `feat/harness-backend` + git log on **2026-07-06 (late night, trunk 7cb221ed)**.
Verification key: ✅ = grep/log-verified today · ❓ = doc claim, re-verify before building.

## Already DONE — do not rebuild (merged 2026-07-05..06)

Release train v0.2.0→v0.2.2 (4-platform signed draft, runbook, gate-after-bump);
polish-sprint lanes **8/8 MERGED** (lane 8 truth-chrome-instruments landed 8e8e6eef while
this file was being written): ux-topbar-disconnect, ux-popup-escape,
voice-button-reliability, truth-run-lifecycle, truth-channel-tee, truth-props-glow,
dossier-agent-mgmt (DELETE AGENT + CHANGE SKIN); update-safety P0.1 wv-cache-purge,
P0.2 mirror-truth, P1.1+P1.2 roster-honesty; voice-desktop-key; comms-fresh-session;
multiplatform install docs. ✅ (all in git log)

## P0 — code: ALL LANDED 2026-07-06 night ✅ (do not rebuild — verify in log/code)

The entire P0-code list from the evening reconcile merged during the update-safety /
audit-fix night wave:

1. Forward-version save guard — LANDED; `save.js` now refuses `doc.version > CURRENT`,
   leaves the doc untouched, reports `{status:'future'}` to boot. (P0.3) ✅ code-verified.
2. Frontend token leak — LANDED a17cb6b3; `X-StarNet-Token` scoped same-origin `/api` only
   (GROUND_UP 0.6) ✅ code-verified.
3. `agent.tool_call` double-emit — LANDED d9a79c6c; chat.js synthetic re-emit dropped
   (GROUND_UP 0.4) ✅.
4. + 5. Sidecar spawn failure + workspace-migration resurrect — LANDED e19aaa21
   "three Tauri-shell data-safety fixes (audit 0.1/0.2/P2)" ✅ log-verified (code ❓ —
   spot-check main.rs if touching that area). Workshop CSP (0.3) also landed efd22244
   (opaque-origin sandbox) ✅.

Also landed the same night from the old P1 list: plaintext BYOK provider key → keychain
(03b07b0d), channel-hub runs in `runsMeta`/snapshot (f9d59968 + e19aaa21 test), approvalMode
persisted (fe3fef98), schema provenance / `git describe` stamp (711f42da, P1.5+P2.1+P2.2),
STT key off the query string (623202af), dirstat fs-jail (f9007c4d), deliverable blob-URL
leak (0cccce2d), VT323 shipped locally (01570f17).

## P0 — Andrew only (nothing above matters to the public until these)

- Publish `starnet-releases` repo (public updater currently 404s) + rescope RELEASES_TOKEN.
- Back up `~/.tauri/starnet-updater.key` to ≥2 offline locations (single point of total loss).
- Rotate the dev OpenRouter key; support email swap.
- **Attended 15-min playtest** (`docs/PLAYTEST_SCRIPT_GATE5.md`) — dodged since 7/02.
- Then per `docs/ROADMAP_2026-07-04_BRUTAL.md`: 10 outside installs; days 8–30 = code-signing
  identity + weekly release cadence; days 31–90 = managed-key starter credits (one SKU).

## P1 — what actually remains open (post-night-wave reconcile)

- **Prompt-injection via auto-granted `team.*` caps** — genuine product fork, needs Andrew
  (see Parked decisions). This is now the ONLY surviving item from the old P1 list — the
  rest landed (see DONE above; P1.3 flush ad8b8b5a, P1.4 parity gate a1a60967 ✅).
- Branch triage below is now the main code queue, plus the P2 hygiene list in
  `docs/GROUND_UP_AUDIT_2026-07-06.md` — do not copy it here.

## Branch triage — EXECUTED 2026-07-06 night ✅ (content-verified per branch, then deleted or parked)

**Deleted (13 unmerged — content proven in trunk or superseded; SHAs recoverable from
reflog ~30 days):** commission-redux 9f8cf7c2 (cherry-equiv in trunk) · cron-staylive
d30dfdd0 (KeepAwake + watchdog in main.rs) · honest-states f1011fe0 (launch.json chore
only) · messaging-platforms 16a0fadd (superseded by MCP connector catalog) ·
starnet-api-gate e4a6fd28 (landed as 9574cb74) · cortex-hermes-plus 80583d9a
(memory-store/transcript/recall/skills all in trunk; its provider abstraction was
abandoned) · hermes-parity-loop 8879b646 (42 commits of proof-plumbing superseded by
release-train + t0–t5) · starnet-hardening-5-6-memory-consent 87b04cd7 +
starnet-memory-consent 3b1470b1 (durable todo: keys + test in trunk) · starnet-memory-loop
bb9369a3 (declined: store in trunk) · quick-model-selector 8a40ddd1 (modeldock + reasoning
efforts in openrouter.js) · starnet-tests-tauri cbb155b9 (landed as 4c8b0f98) ·
workstreams-sessions-ui 9ae72942 (23-line net change, rail evolved past it).

**Also torn down: 10 already-MERGED branches + worktrees** (byok-coldstart,
connector-catalog, secrets-keychain, update-host clean; comms-picker, honest-errors,
retention-p3, ux-hints, cron-visibility-plan, prop-upgrade had only launch-config/QA-artifact
dirt — cron plan doc salvaged to docs/archive/).

**KEPT — real value, in priority order:**
1. `agent/belt-reclaim` (293c869e, 7/6) — drag-to-clear a whole belt run in one undo slot
   + hover tint + test; VERIFIED absent from trunk (trunk reclaim is single-tile only).
   **IN PROGRESS — brain-session 2026-07-06 ~23:55: trunk merged into worktree (93187767),
   gate running, will merge if green.**
2. `agent/growth-t4` (ac7bf9f5) — T4 beat-balance pass (516 lines: prioritized ask stream,
   no-double-beats proof, beat-audit script + 201-line test) **plus ~411 lines UNCOMMITTED
   in its worktree** (iteration from 7/02). Needs its author-lane to finish or an explicit
   decision to adopt/discard the dirty work. Do NOT tear down.
3. `agent/parity-finish` (1c203a50) — code all landed (fs.patch, V4A parser, mcp stdio),
   but the branch carries far richer tests (549-line fs.patch.test vs trunk's 131).
   Harvest-tests task: port the extra cases against trunk's stricter parser, then delete.
4. `agent/ui-number-format` (4af14e29) — canonical U.usd/U.tokens exist in util.js but
   dupes remain (clip.js fmtUsd, etc.). Low-risk consolidation refactor; low priority.

**Merged-but-DIRTY worktrees left in place** (real uncommitted code deltas — inspect
before any teardown; `-Force` discards): auto-memory, bug-patterns, connector-spine (50
files!), hermes-settings-audit, live-polish, mac-linux-support (23), meeseeks-subagents,
skins (14), starnet-build-skills-crop, starnet-security-check, starnet-spend-model-honesty,
truth-chrome-instruments (tonight's; its orchestrator tears down).
Rule stands: land it or delete it — an unmerged branch is a claim nobody verified.

## Parked product decisions (need Andrew, don't guess)

- `fullOffice()` autonomous prop placement vs. hand-placed only.
- localLine slash-command restyle; focusAgent global-model overwrite semantics.
- Prompt-injection stance on auto-granted `team.*` (see P1).

## Session handoff format

End every substantive session by:
1. Updating THIS file (move landed items to DONE with the merge hash, add discoveries).
2. If you merged to trunk: the `starnet-merge-ritual` digest in `qa/` (existing convention).
3. A 3-line summary in your final report: **Landed** (verified how) / **Open** (what you
   did NOT verify) / **Next** (the single highest-leverage follow-up).
Do not create new `*_PLAN.md` files for work under ~a week; use this queue.
