# Session 3 - Desktop Release Gate

## Current slice

WATCH mode / desktop package proof. No release-code changes were made because the
runbook-listed hardening/Tauri lanes are still active or unmerged.

## Changed files

- `docs/session-status/session-3-release-gate.md`

## Desktop packaging checks

- `npm.cmd ci` - PASS; installed locked local `@tauri-apps/cli` dependency in this
  worktree so `tauri build` resolves.
- First `npm.cmd run desktop:build` attempt timed out while `scripts/prepare-node.mjs`
  downloaded the bundled Windows Node runtime. The child completed and left
  `src-tauri/binaries/node-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe` present as a gitignored build
  input.
- Second `npm.cmd run desktop:build` after dependency install reached Tauri and failed:
  `failed to run cargo metadata --no-deps --format-version 1: program not found`.
- 2026-06-26T03:57-04:00 `npm.cmd run desktop:build` confirmed
  `scripts/prepare-node.mjs` skipped because
  `src-tauri/binaries/node-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe` is already present, then Tauri
  failed at `cargo metadata --no-deps --format-version 1: program not found`.
- 2026-06-26T04:52-04:00 `npm.cmd run desktop:build` again confirmed

## Live verification

Not run. Packaged app boot, updater/install smoke, screenshot proof, and zero-console
release smoke require a successful desktop package build.

## Blockers / holds

- HELD-FOR-UPSTREAM: Session 3 remains in WATCH mode while the runbook-listed active
  Tauri/hardening lanes are unmerged. Current board shows
  `agent/starnet-hardening-integration` clean/merged locally, with unmerged
  `agent/starnet-hardening-7-8-tests-tauri` and `agent/starnet-tests-tauri`.
- Board check on 2026-06-26T03:50-04:00 reported no uncommitted tracked edits
  matching `docs/session-status/session-3-release-gate.md`.
- Board check on 2026-06-26T04:51-04:00 reported no uncommitted tracked edits
  matching `docs/session-status/session-3-release-gate.md`.
- Board check on 2026-06-26T05:51-04:00 reported no uncommitted tracked edits
  matching `docs/session-status/session-3-release-gate.md`.
- Board check on 2026-06-26T13:58-04:00 reported no uncommitted tracked edits
  matching `docs/session-status/session-3-release-gate.md`; it still listed
  `agent/starnet-hardening-7-8-tests-tauri` and `agent/starnet-tests-tauri` as
  unmerged, with `agent/starnet-hardening-integration` clean/merged locally.
- Board check on 2026-06-26T14:58-04:00 reported no uncommitted tracked edits
  matching `docs/session-status/session-3-release-gate.md`; it still listed
  `agent/starnet-hardening-7-8-tests-tauri` and `agent/starnet-tests-tauri` as
  unmerged, with `agent/starnet-hardening-integration` clean/merged locally.
- Board check on 2026-06-26T15:59-04:00 reported no uncommitted tracked edits
  matching `docs/session-status/session-3-release-gate.md`; it still listed
  `agent/starnet-hardening-7-8-tests-tauri` and `agent/starnet-tests-tauri` as
  unmerged, with `agent/starnet-hardening-integration` clean/merged locally.
- Board check on 2026-06-26T17:01-04:00 reported no uncommitted tracked edits
  matching `docs/session-status/session-3-release-gate.md`; it still listed
  `agent/starnet-hardening-7-8-tests-tauri` and `agent/starnet-tests-tauri` as
  unmerged, with `agent/starnet-hardening-integration` clean/merged locally.
- Board check on 2026-06-26T18:02-04:00 reported no uncommitted tracked edits

  `agent/starnet-hardening-7-8-tests-tauri` and `agent/starnet-tests-tauri` as
  unmerged, with `agent/starnet-hardening-integration` clean/merged locally.
- Sync check on 2026-06-26T18:02-04:00 showed this worktree is `11` commits behind
  and `8` commits ahead of local `feat/harness-backend`; no rebase was attempted
  while the lane remains in WATCH mode.
- BLOCKED-RUST-TOOLCHAIN: `npm.cmd run desktop:build` cannot pass until Cargo/Rust are
  installed and visible on PATH. Exact failing subcommand: `cargo metadata --no-deps
  --format-version 1`.
- `AGENTS.md` was not present in this worktree or under `C:\Users\andro\gen-trees`
  during the 2026-06-26T04:50-04:00 preflight search.

## Readiness claim

Not ready. Pre-build JS/HTTP gates are green, but the lane is still held by upstream
Tauri hardening branches and blocked locally on the Rust/Cargo toolchain before desktop
packaging can complete.

## Next loop condition

Wake after a trunk merge that lands or retires the Tauri hardening lanes, then rerun:

1. `git worktree list`
2. `git status --short --branch`
3. `node scripts/board.mjs --files docs/session-status/session-3-release-gate.md`
4. `npm.cmd run test:fast`
5. `npm.cmd run test:http`
6. `npm.cmd run desktop:build` after Cargo/Rust are installed
