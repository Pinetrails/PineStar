# Session 4 - Managed Credits Status

## Current Slice

- Tightened managed-credit durable ledger failure handling while route integration remains held.
- Selected invariant: managed-credit final settlement must fail closed when the spend ledger cannot durably append the final truth.

## Changed Files

- `sidecar/billing.js`
- `sidecar/ledger.js`
- `test/billing.test.js`
- `test/ledger.test.js`
- `docs/session-status/session-4-managed-credits.md`

## Evidence

- `sidecar/ledger.js` now exposes `recordStrict()` for paid-credit paths that must surface durable append failures.
- Existing `ledger.record()` remains fail-open for legacy/non-managed callers, preserving the current run ledger behavior.
- `sidecar/billing.js` now prefers `ledger.recordStrict()` for managed-credit final settlement when available.
- A strict durable append failure refuses managed finalization before any refund is emitted, records no in-memory false success, and leaves the run unsettled for retry/recovery.
- Existing managed reservation, failed-run refund, BYOK isolation, debit throw, explicit adapter refusal, missing refund adapter, cap kill, legacy ledger failure, and run identity conflict behavior still passes.
- `AGENTS.md` is absent under `C:\Users\andro\gen-trees`; `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/STARNET_SESSION_LOOPS_1_6.md` were followed.
- `node scripts\board.mjs --files sidecar\billing.js sidecar\ledger.js test\billing.test.js test\ledger.test.js docs\session-status\session-4-managed-credits.md` reported no uncommitted tracked edits matching `sidecar\billing.js`; contended files remain limited to unrelated/shared route/UI surfaces including `sidecar/index.js`.

## Tests Run

- `node test\billing.test.js` - OK, 74 assertions.
- `node test\budget.test.js` - OK, 49 assertions.
- `node test\ledger.test.js` - OK, 29 assertions.
- `npm.cmd run test:fast` - OK.

## Full Gates

- `npm.cmd run test:fast` - green on 2026-06-26 at 2026-06-26T18:04:00-04:00.
- `npm.cmd run test:http` - not run; this slice added no HTTP route.

## Live Verification

- Not run; this slice is pure backend billing code and does not expose UI or HTTP behavior.
- No real managed-credit provider or real-money spend was used.

## Blockers / Holds

- HELD-FOR-COORDINATION: `sidecar/index.js` remains listed as a contended file on the generated board, so `/api/run` managed-credit admission wiring was not attempted in this loop.
- HELD-FOR-COORDINATION: route/HUD selection work still waits until backend invariants are complete and hot route ownership is clear.
- `test/billing.test.js` is not wired into `test:fast` because `package.json` is outside the Session 4 owned-file list in the runbook.

## Readiness Claim

- Safe checkpoint slice is ready: strict durable ledger append failures now fail closed for managed final settlement before refund, and the full fast gate is green.
- Session 4 done condition is not yet met; route integration, run-loop/HUD selection, HTTP tests, strict durable managed-ledger persistence, and fake-provider live smoke remain.

## Next Loop Condition

- Retry `node scripts/board.mjs --files sidecar/index.js sidecar/ledger.js`; if `sidecar/index.js` is no longer hot, wire managed-credit authorization plus the budget resume guard into the run admission/resume routes and add fake-provider HTTP coverage. If route files remain held, select another pure backend invariant.
