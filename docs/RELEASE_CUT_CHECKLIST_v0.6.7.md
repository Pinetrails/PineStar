# v0.6.7 cut checklist — prepared 2026-07-25, REFRESHED 2026-07-26 @ 10d837d0

> **Read the 07-26 refresh first — three things in the original text are now wrong.**
> Corrections are marked **[07-26]** inline. Summary:
> 1. §A's state table was stale in your favour: Guardian and journeys are green **at the exact
>    current head** right now, and trunk is 28 commits ahead of origin, not 197.
> 2. §C step 8's claim that the branch push publishes starnetos.com is **wrong** — re-measured
>    today. It doesn't, and it doesn't need to. See **[07-26] §C8**.
> 3. Version is **0.6.7**, re-confirmed by Andrew 2026-07-26. (This worktree is misleadingly
>    named `update-0-7-7-release`; there is no 0.7.7.)
>
> Added: **§E — upgrade safety**, the "will this break existing installs" question, proven
> rather than argued.

Written while Andrew is still merging. Everything here was verified against code/live endpoints
at 62706fb9, not read out of a plan doc. `docs/RELEASE_RUNBOOK.md` is the general procedure; this
is the tonight-specific version, with the parts that are actually stale in the runbook corrected.

## A. State at prep time

**[07-26] Live state, re-measured at `10d837d0`** — this supersedes the table below it:

| Thing | State 2026-07-26 21:0x Z |
|---|---|
| Trunk | `feat/harness-backend` @ `10d837d0` |
| Commits since `v0.6.6` | 349 total · **142 substantive** · 2,391 files |
| Guardian last cycle | **GREEN, all 6 gates, no skips, AT `10d837d0` = current head** (stamped 21:06Z) |
| Journeys | **PASS 129/129 at `10d837d0`** (same stamp) |
| Beginner Run | PASS but at `2b40689b` — **behind head, must be re-run** (`maxTrunkDrift` is 0) |
| Installed-exe smoke | still BLOCKED, v0.6.3 bytes — same waiver call as B2 below |
| Unpushed on trunk | **28** commits ahead of `origin/feat/harness-backend` (was 197 at prep) |
| `src-tauri/` diff vs `v0.6.6` | **EMPTY — zero bytes changed.** See §E |
| `shared/events.js` diff | additive only (2 optional budget fields + `credits.low`) |
| Version fields | 0.6.6 across all three, still consistent, no BOM |

So at this moment **only the Beginner Run is owed** to earn READY — and it, Guardian and
journeys all expire the instant the next merge lands. Nothing here can be banked; it is the
last step before the bump, not the first.

<details><summary>Original 07-25 state table (superseded)</summary>

| Thing | State |
|---|---|
| Trunk | `feat/harness-backend` @ `62706fb9` |
| Shipped version | 0.6.6 (`package.json`, `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` — all three agree, no BOM) |
| Commits since `v0.6.6` | 245 total · **105 substantive** (rest are qa/claims/status) |
| `npm run test:fast` | **GREEN — 392 steps** at 62706fb9 |
| Guardian last cycle | GREEN, all 6 gates, no skips — but at `e118c759` (13 commits behind head) |
| Journeys | PASS 129/129 at `e118c759` |
| Beginner Run | PASS (ui-only) at `e118c759` |
| Ledger | 0 P0 · 0 P1 · 0 P2 |
| Installed-exe smoke | **BLOCKED**, v0.6.3 bytes, stamped 2026-07-20 |
| Unpushed on trunk | **197 commits** ahead of `origin/feat/harness-backend` (`0b48a904`) |
| Updater signing key | present at `~/.tauri/starnet-updater.key` (+ `.pub`) |
| Actions secrets on `androoAGI/starnet` | `RELEASES_TOKEN` (2026-07-22), `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY`, `AZURE_TENANT_ID`/`CLIENT_ID`/`CLIENT_SECRET` |

</details>

Note on secrets: there is **no** `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD` secret. That is correct —
the key's password is the empty string and an absent secret resolves to empty. There are also **no
`APPLE_*` secrets**, so the mac legs are updater-signed (minisign) but not Apple-notarized; the
train has a documented fallback for exactly this. Unchanged from v0.6.6.

---

## B. Blockers found during prep

### B1 — Mac in-app auto-update is BROKEN on the live v0.6.6 feed (pre-existing)

Proven with `npm run release:verify-host` against the live endpoint just now: **4 FAILs.**

`latest.json` on the published v0.6.6 release advertises five platforms:

```
windows-x86_64, darwin-aarch64, darwin-x86_64, linux-x86_64, linux-x86_64-deb
```

The release actually carries only five files: `latest.json`, the exe, the exe `.sig`, and the two
DMGs. So:

- `windows-x86_64` → exe + `.sig` present → **HTTP 200, works.**
- `darwin-aarch64` → `StarNet_darwin-arm64.app.tar.gz` → **HTTP 404.**
- `darwin-x86_64` → `StarNet_darwin-x64.app.tar.gz` → **HTTP 404.**
- both `linux-*` → **HTTP 404.**

A Mac user on v0.6.5 who opens UPDATE CENTER and clicks INSTALL UPDATE gets a download failure.
The DMG is the *manual* installer; the `.app.tar.gz` + `.sig` is what the updater consumes. The
publish-time strip that enforces the Windows+Mac-only download policy removed the mac updater
bundles along with the linux ones.

Second-order effect: because the reachability loop in `verify-update-host.mjs` iterates **every**
platform present in the manifest (`--require-platforms` only controls which must be *present*, it
does not scope the URL check), `npm run release:verify-host` is structurally incapable of passing
while linux keys ride in the manifest. Step 1.9 of the runbook has been permanently red.

**DECIDED (Andrew, 2026-07-25): publish-time fix only, no code change.** At publish, strip only
the four linux assets. **Keep** the two mac `.app.tar.gz` files and their `.sig`s attached
(~104MB extra on the release). Mac auto-update starts working with v0.6.7.

`verify-host` will still flag the two linux 404s. That is expected, not a failure of the cut —
scope the check to the platforms that are actually published:

```bash
npm run release:verify-host -- --expect-version 0.6.7 \
  --require-platforms windows-x86_64,darwin-aarch64,darwin-x86_64
```

Deferred to a later cut (not tonight): dropping the `ubuntu-22.04` leg from the train matrix and
teaching `release-assemble-manifest.mjs` an `--only-platforms` filter, so the manifest itself
matches [release-platforms-law] and `verify-host` goes green with no flags.

### B2 — Installed-exe smoke has to be re-earned, and it is the long pole

`checkInstalled` in `scripts/qa/ready.mjs` requires `buildCommit` AND `expectedHead` AND
`sourceTree` to equal the **current trunk head and tree**. The stamp on disk is v0.6.3 bytes from
2026-07-20 with `result: BLOCKED`. It cannot be inherited — it has to be re-earned from a build of
the exact cut commit, which means a full Rust desktop build (10–30 min, plus install + smoke).

This gate was waived at the v0.6.4 and v0.6.5 cuts. Waiving it again is a legitimate call, but it
should be a decision, not a surprise at 2am.

### B3 — Everything the READY gate checks expires at the final merge

`maxTrunkDrift` is **0** and the freshness window is 24h, so Guardian, Journeys and the Beginner
Run must all run at the *exact* commit being cut. Any merge after they run invalidates them.
There is no way to pre-earn these — they are the last thing before the bump, not the first.

---

## C. The cut, in order

Run this **after the last merge lands**. Nothing before step 3 can be banked early.

### 1. Version — DECIDED: `0.6.7`

Andrew's call, 2026-07-25: stays on the 0.6.x line. The notes draft is titled for it.

### 2. Freeze

Announce the freeze. Any merge after the QA runs below invalidates them (B3).

### 3. Earn the READY gate at the final commit

```bash
npm run qa:guardian && npm run qa:beginner && npm run qa:ready
```

Guardian runs test-fast + http-e2e + shoot + golden + audit + journeys, so it covers the journeys
stamp too. Expect READY with one FAIL: installed-exe smoke (B2). Any *other* red stops the cut.

> **Golden-frame trap:** if the `golden` gate goes red, re-bless from the Guardian pin at
> `C:\Users\andro\Desktop\_qa-guardian-pin`, never from the dev repo — a bless captured in the dev
> repo does not reproduce in the pin and reads as a phantom regression. Guardian was green at
> `e118c759` today, so this is currently clear.

### 4. Stage the notes

`docs/RELEASE_NOTES_v0.6.7_DRAFT.md` holds the body, current through 62706fb9. Re-run the delta
command in its header, append anything new, then it is ready to paste.

### 5. Bump

```bash
npm run release:bump 0.6.7
```

Bumps `tauri.conf.json` + `Cargo.toml` (+ `Cargo.lock`), scaffolds `RELEASE_NOTES.md`, commits,
tags locally. Pushes nothing.

Then replace the scaffold body with the draft and fold it into the release commit:

```bash
git add RELEASE_NOTES.md && git commit --amend --no-edit && git tag -f v0.6.7
```

### 6. W0 re-stamp — then move the tag

Shipped-surface commits need the claims re-lock, and **the tag must sit on the stamp commit, not
before it**. That ordering is what made the v0.6.5 train pass its gate on the first try with no
re-fire. After the stamp lands:

```bash
git tag -f v0.6.7
```

### 7. Gate again, post-bump, pre-push

```bash
npm run test:fast
```

A fixture coupled to the version number is what burned both v0.2.0 and v0.2.1. Green here means
the train's gate job is green.

### 8. Push — branch and tag together

> ### [07-26] CORRECTION — the branch push does NOT publish starnetos.com
>
> Everything below about `release-train.yml` is right. The website half is **wrong**, and it was
> re-measured today, not inferred:
>
> - `curl -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' https://api.github.com/repos/androoAGI/starnet/pages`
>   → **404**. GitHub Pages was never enabled. `deploy-website.yml` fires on the push and
>   **fails red every time**. Expect that X in Actions; it is noise, not a broken release.
> - `curl -sI https://starnetos.com` → `Server: cloudflare`. The live site is **Cloudflare Pages
>   direct upload**, which has no git integration. It only moves when someone runs
>   `wrangler pages deploy website --project-name starnet-site`.
>
> **The good news: the release does not need a site deploy.** `website/site.js` fetches
> `api.github.com/repos/androoAGI/starnet-releases/releases/latest` on page load and rewrites
> both the version strings (`#ver-badge`, `#ver-foot`, `.ver`) and every download button's
> `href` from the live release assets. The download page follows the new release on its own,
> within minutes of publishing, with no deploy at all.
>
> Two consequences worth knowing:
> - `FALLBACK_VERSION = '0.6.6'` in `website/site.js:5` is what a visitor sees only if that API
>   call fails (offline / rate-limited). Bumping it is cosmetic and **requires a wrangler
>   deploy to take effect** — it is not part of the cut.
> - The download buttons match assets by substring: `x64-setup.exe` also matches
>   `x64-setup.exe.sig`, and `assets.find()` takes the first hit. It works today only because
>   GitHub returns assets alphabetically (`.exe` sorts before `.exe.sig`) — verified against the
>   live v0.6.6 release. Adding the two mac `.app.tar.gz` bundles introduces no new collision
>   (`aarch64.dmg` doesn't match them). **Re-check once after publish** (§10).
>
> **DECISION OWED:** `website/pricing.html` **is now on trunk** (`b4315d74`), linked from all ten
> docs pages and in `sitemap.xml`. The original note below saying it "is not on trunk" is stale.
> Because the site doesn't auto-deploy, it stays invisible tonight either way — but the next
> wrangler deploy publishes a public pricing page for a subscription whose client side is still
> held. Decide deliberately; don't let a routine site deploy ship it by accident.

**Original 07-25 text (website half superseded above):**

```bash
git push origin feat/harness-backend
git push origin v0.6.7
```

The two pushes drive two independent workflows — worth knowing which does what, because they can
be separated if anything goes wrong mid-cut:

- `release-train.yml` → `on: push: tags: ['v*']` — the **tag** starts the train. It does not
  touch the website (a tag push cannot match a branch filter).
- `deploy-website.yml` → `on: push: branches: [main, feat/harness-backend], paths: ['website/**']`
  — the **branch** publishes the site.

Trunk is 197 commits ahead of origin, and **16 of those touch `website/`**, so the branch push is
what puts **starnetos.com** (`website/CNAME`) live: the rewritten landing page, the live
in-browser app preview, ten docs pages, the legal pages. Watch the `deploy-website` run in Actions
alongside the train.

> The credits/pricing page is *not* in this set — `website/pricing.html` is not on trunk, so the
> subscriptions lane stays unshipped either way.

> **Push classifier trap:** if `git push` is blocked from PowerShell, run the identical push through
> the Bash tool — it has passed immediately every time PowerShell was blocked.

### 9. Watch the train

Actions → release-train for `v0.6.7`: **gate → build (4 legs) → assemble → stage-draft.** A single
red leg is usually a runner flake — Re-run failed jobs. `stage-draft` is idempotent.

### 10. Review + publish the draft

Draft lands on `androoAGI/starnet-releases`. Before publishing:

- version/tag exactly `v0.6.7`; notes are the real body, not the TODO scaffold
- every updater artifact has a matching `.sig`; exactly one `latest.json`

**Strip exactly four assets** (the linux ones), and nothing else:

```
StarNet_0.6.7_amd64.AppImage        + .sig
StarNet_0.6.7_amd64.deb             + .sig
```

**Keep attached** — this is the B1 fix, and it is the difference between mac auto-update working
and 404ing:

```
StarNet_0.6.7_x64-setup.exe         + .sig     (windows updater + manual download)
StarNet_darwin-arm64.app.tar.gz     + .sig     (mac updater feed, Apple Silicon)
StarNet_darwin-x64.app.tar.gz       + .sig     (mac updater feed, Intel)
StarNet_0.6.7_aarch64.dmg                      (manual download, Apple Silicon)
StarNet_0.6.7_x64.dmg                          (manual download, Intel)
latest.json
```

That is 9 assets published, versus the 5 that shipped at v0.6.6.

Then Publish (the only human ship gate), and verify against the platforms actually published:

```bash
npm run release:verify-host -- --expect-version 0.6.7 --require-platforms windows-x86_64,darwin-aarch64,darwin-x86_64
```

Expect PASS on all three published platforms, and two FAILs on the linux keys still listed in the
manifest. Those two are known and accepted for this cut (B1).

> **[07-26] Also verify the site's download buttons resolve to installers, not signatures.** The
> matcher is a substring (`x64-setup.exe` also matches `x64-setup.exe.sig`) and relies on GitHub
> returning assets alphabetically. One command:
>
> ```bash
> curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/androoAGI/starnet-releases/releases/latest | node -e "let d='';process.stdin.on('data',c=>d+=c).on('end',()=>{const a=(JSON.parse(d).assets||[]).map(x=>x.name);const w=a.find(n=>n.includes('x64-setup.exe'));const m=a.find(n=>n.includes('aarch64.dmg'));console.log('win ->',w,w&&!w.endsWith('.sig')?'OK':'BAD');console.log('mac ->',m,m?'OK':'BAD');})"
> ```

### 11. Post-publish

- Mirror the release on `androoAGI/starnet` (source repo) with exe + both DMGs.
- Delete the v0.6.6 release + tags on **both** repos — only the current version stays downloadable.
  Published-release deletion is classifier-blocked for me; it is a manual UI step (each repo →
  Releases → v0.6.6 → Delete, then Tags → v0.6.6 → delete).

  **Already done during prep:** the v0.6.6 assets are archived locally at
  `release/archive/v0.6.6/` (copied from `release/verify-0.6.6/`, sizes match the published
  release exactly), so the delete is unblocked:

  ```
  StarNet_0.6.6_x64-setup.exe   ef4974f957b2bf45dc3604b5d10b8a09be0fd7a8a7c1b022d24b4dbb97c75fcd
  StarNet_0.6.6_aarch64.dmg     4ec54423501053b8df452e928cb7471632e2ede5a6045fbb2c5fff05ad22c067
  StarNet_0.6.6_x64.dmg         f68c1250856d67ed592c2257bdc4573280c3b08e433242ef81dbabfea4f1a39b
  ```
  (plus the exe `.sig` and `latest.json`.)
- The live v0.6.6 release bodies still carry x64-for-all mac wording — patch at this cut.
- Still open from v0.6.5: VirusTotal + Defender false-positive submissions for the signed exe;
  Apple notarization ($99), which would let the `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine` step die.

---

## D. Known-stale docs (do not follow blindly)

- `docs/RELEASE_RUNBOOK.md` §1.7 and §5.4 demand all five platform keys including Linux before
  publishing. That contradicts [release-platforms-law] (Windows + Mac only) and is the source of B1.
- The runbook's "VERIFICATION STATUS" block still says nothing has ever been published and the last
  built version is 0.4.1. Six releases have shipped since.
- `docs/BRAIN.md` claims shipped version v0.2.2 and lists unsigned binaries as a bottleneck. Every
  agent session reads it first.
- `scripts/release-cut.mjs` — **`--help` runs a real cut.** There is no help flag. Do not probe it.

---

## E. [07-26] Upgrade safety — will v0.6.7 break an existing install?

The question Andrew asked before this cut. Answered by measurement, not by argument.

### E1 — The installer and updater are byte-identical to the ones that shipped

```
git diff v0.6.6..HEAD -- src-tauri/    →  EMPTY
```

Zero bytes changed in the Tauri layer across 349 commits. That means **every mechanism that
decides where the app installs and where its data lives is the same code that already performed
a successful v0.6.5 → v0.6.6 update in production**:

| Thing | Value | Changed? |
|---|---|---|
| `identifier` | `ai.skynet.harness` | no |
| `productName` | `StarNet` | no |
| NSIS `installMode` | `passive` | no |
| Updater `endpoints` | `releases/latest/download/latest.json` | no |
| Updater `pubkey` | `dW50cnVzdGVk…` (minisign) | no |
| Data dir the shell passes as `SKYNET_WORKSPACES` | `%APPDATA%\ai.skynet.harness\workspaces` | no |

An unchanged `identifier` is the one that matters most: it is what makes Windows install *over*
the existing app instead of beside it, and what keeps the data directory pointing at the same
place. A side-by-side install is the classic way an update reads as "it deleted everything."
That failure mode is structurally impossible here.

The residual risk is therefore **not the installer — it is the data layer**: 349 commits of
frontend and sidecar change reading a save file written by an older build.

### E2 — Proven: a real, old profile opens clean on the new build

Method (2026-07-26): copied Andrew's live desktop profile
(`%APPDATA%\ai.skynet.harness\workspaces`, 305 MB, `last-run-version` = **0.6.3**, schemaVersion 1
— i.e. *older* than the 0.6.6 a real updating user will have, so this is the harder case) to
scratch, and booted trunk `10d837d0` against the copy with `SKYNET_WORKSPACES` on port 8799.
The original was never written to.

Result:

- **Boots clean.** No error, no exception, no `ENOENT`/`EACCES`, no migration failure in the log.
- **Everything came back.** The live UI showed the crew member `ULTRON` (Lv 1, idle), the full
  session list going back 6 days, the restored COMMS transcript including an old "while you were
  away" delivery card with its two files, and the model pin `GPT 5.6 SOL`.
- **Zero browser console errors** after full UI load — this is the check that would catch a store
  whose shape the new frontend can't read.
- **`agent.save.json` was not modified at all.** Its 17 `doc` keys and the agent survived intact.
- Five files were rewritten at boot, all of them runtime state, none of them user config:
  `_commander.autonomy.json`, `_station.questrefresh.json`, `agent.roster.json`,
  `agent.workshop.json`, `scout.state.json`. `agent.roster.json`'s `agents` array is
  **byte-identical** — only its `updatedAt` moved.
- `skills.jsonl` is compacted at boot (`5,597,419 B → 17 entries`). This looks alarming in the
  log and is not: it is append-log compaction. 184 lines held **17 unique keys**; the compacted
  file holds the same **17**, with **0 unique keys lost**. Verified by diffing the key sets.

### E3 — Behaviour changes an existing user WILL notice (put them in the notes, not in a bug report)

None of these break anything. All of them are visible on first launch, which is exactly why they
belong in the release notes — an unexplained change reads as a regression.

1. **The station looks different.** The default deck moved `plate` → `spine` and the default wall
   `plating` → `bulkhead`. Both commits state the change reaches **stations already built**
   deliberately (a station that never chose a floor carries `floorMat: null` and renders the
   default). `plate`/`plating` remain in the palette. → covered in the notes draft.
2. **Spend caps start firing on Anthropic and Google.** `sidecar/providers/prices.js` gives those
   two providers real per-token pricing; previously `spentUsd` stayed `0.00` on them, so a
   configured per-run ceiling could never trigger. Blast radius is small — `maxCostUsd` defaults
   to `Infinity` (`sidecar/loop.js:187`), so only a user who *explicitly set* a cap sees a
   change, and what they see is their own cap finally working.
3. **Fewer tools are advertised per request.** Browser sub-tools are `deferred: true` in the
   capability registry — still granted, reachable via `tool.search`. Agents behave slightly
   differently; nothing was revoked.

### E4 — What is still NOT proven

Stated plainly so it isn't mistaken for coverage:

- **The in-app update itself was not exercised end-to-end.** E1 is a code-identity argument, E2 is
  a data-layer proof. Neither one is "clicked INSTALL UPDATE on a v0.6.6 install and watched it
  land." That is the installed-exe smoke (B2), still waived.
- **Mac auto-update has never once succeeded in production** — it 404s today (B1). v0.6.7 is the
  first build that can fix it, and the fix is publish-time (§10, keep the 9 assets). It cannot be
  verified before publishing, only after. A mac user on 0.6.6 clicking INSTALL UPDATE tonight
  still fails; they must download manually this one last time.
