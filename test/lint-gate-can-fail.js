/* node test/lint-gate-can-fail.js — every gate step that asserts must be ABLE to turn the gate red.

   THE HOLE THIS CLOSES (found 2026-07-25): test/_assert.js accumulates failures in a counter and ONLY
   `report()` calls process.exit(fail ? 1 : 0). A test that ends in a bare `console.log('... OK')` therefore
   prints "FAIL: ..." for every broken assertion and STILL exits 0 — the runner scores it green. SEVEN gate
   steps were in that state (diagnostics-support-email, interests, scout, run-truth, mcp.catalog, widgets,
   and servicekeys — the last one adopted INTO the gate while broken, by the very lane that found the others).
   None happened to be failing, so nothing was concealed at the time; the point is that none of them COULD
   have caught a future regression. A gate step that cannot fail is worse than no step: it reports safety.

   This lint enumerates the REAL gate (test/fast.list + the test:http:raw chain in package.json), keeps the
   steps that use the _assert.js helpers, and requires each to end its run by calling report() (or to own its
   exit explicitly via process.exit / fails()). It reads the SAME sources the runners read, so a step added to
   either gate is covered automatically — there is no second list to drift. */
