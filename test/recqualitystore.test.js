/* node test/recqualitystore.test.js — THE OUTCOME LOOP (frontend/app/recqualitystore.js).
   The arithmetic lives in the pure recquality.js (tested separately); this is the live glue, and the thing it
   has to get right is ATTRIBUTION: an accepted offer → the run it spawned → that run's real outcome. Locks:
     - weights start NEUTRAL and are read neutral for an unknown channel (a cold store changes no ranking)
     - an accept that spawns work credits NOTHING until the work produces an outcome (a click is not a result)
     - the stamp is claimed by the FIRST hero run after the accept, never by a worker's run, never twice
     - a clean finish folds a weak positive; a stop/error/limit folds NOTHING (an interrupted run is not the
       suggestion's fault, and the harness cannot honestly say otherwise)
     - the Commander's 👍/👌/👎 on the attributed run is the strong signal; an UNattributed run says nothing
     - weights persist, hydrate clamped, and reset() clears them for a new hero
     - a dud channel gets quieter but is never silenced (the floor holds through the whole live path) */
