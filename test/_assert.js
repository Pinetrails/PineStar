/* SILENT-EARLY-EXIT GUARD (2026-07-25). Calling report() is necessary but not sufficient: a file can EXIT

   That is not hypothetical — it happened while adding a browser test here. Node's event loop can drain
   mid-await when the only thing outstanding is an unref'd timer (the CDP client unrefs its timeout timers),
   and an un-awaited async IIFE has the same effect. Both look identical to the runner: no output, exit 0.
   So: if any assertion ran and the process leaves with a success code without report() having been called,
   turn it red and say why. A test whose asserts never finished is a failing test, not a passing one. */
