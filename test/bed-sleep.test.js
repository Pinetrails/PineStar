/* test/bed-sleep.test.js — AN AGENT SLEEPS IN THE BED (2026-08-10).

   Before this, a placed BED was somewhere a dormant body stood NEXT TO: planBedSleep walked it to an
   adjacent tile and powered it down on its feet, because the seat law (rightly) bans the chair-sit pose
   on a mattress. The Commander asked for the real thing — in the bed, under the red covers, head poking
   out — so the bed now paints in TWO passes with the body between them, and the nap has its own idle
   lane instead of riding the rarely-fired drift-mood power-down.

   The render half below is executable (the propsprites module runs bare in node); the behavior half is
   a source lock, because world.js is a browser module with no headless harness. Both halves guard the
   same failure: a quilt that paints over nothing, or a body posed on a bed it never claimed. */
