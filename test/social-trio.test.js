/* node test/social-trio.test.js — W5 (2026-08-14): MORE conversations, and a THREE-body one.

   THE ASK, verbatim: "I really like when the agent sprites talk to one another but it seems to very
   very rarely happen... sometimes 2, or maybe even 3 of them just start communicating."

   Two separate claims, and this file locks both, because each has a way of silently reverting:

   RATE — the encounter was governed by four multiplying gates, and tuning only the obvious one is
   how W4 already failed to fix this once. The locks below pin the three NON-obvious halves: the
   silent kinds draw their own short cooldown instead of spending the conversation budget, the
   talking kinds are selected FIRST, and the candidate radius is wider than the distance between two
   desks. A future "simplify the tuning" pass that folds the two lanes back into one, or restores the
   old kind order, puts the rarity straight back — so those are assertions, not comments.

   TRIO — turn-taking generalised from a boolean (am I the first speaker?) to a seat in a roster.
   The property that makes a conversation legible is that exactly ONE mouth moves at a time, and with
   three bodies that is no longer nearly-free: a naive "everyone talks while held" reads as a crowd.
   `% n` round-robin makes overlap unrepresentable, and this file sweeps it to prove that for n=3 and
   n=2 alike — including that n=2 is byte-identical to the shipped W4 alternation, since a pair is
   the common case and must not regress in the name of the rare one.

   Same extraction discipline as test/talk-turn.test.js: world.js is a browser IIFE, so the marked
   TALK-TURN-PURE block is sliced out of the SOURCE and executed — the shipped decision is under
   test, not a copy of it. */
