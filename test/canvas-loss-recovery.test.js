/* node test/canvas-loss-recovery.test.js — THE STATION MAY NEVER SILENTLY GO BLACK.

   Reported by Andrew on 0.10.2: "the station randomly went black and the only thing that appears
   is the agents, and the props." That symptom names its cause. Every layer that is NOT redrawn
   from scratch each frame lives in an offscreen <canvas> — the station bake (floors/walls/hull +
   lightmap), the SpaceBG sky, the Terrain ground. Agents draw from <img> sprite sheets and props
   draw procedurally, so those two rebuild every frame, and those two are exactly what survived.

   A GPU/driver reset (sleep-wake, display or DPI change, a TDR, the WebView's GPU process
   restarting) zeroes the backing store of every accelerated 2D canvas: the objects survive at
   full size, the PIXELS do not, and nothing throws. `cache` stays a well-formed bake, frameBody
   blits a transparent plate every frame, and it NEVER heals — a bake only re-runs when the
   geometry changes, and no geometry changed.

   Measured live in the seeded app (worktree agent/black-station, 808x752 stage) by zeroing the
   plates in place via World._dbgLoseCanvases():
       healthy frame   86.15% non-black px, mean luma 26.44
       plates zeroed   15.88% non-black px, mean luma  6.93   <- the reported frame
       after watchdog  86.18% non-black px, mean luma 26.23
   The 15.88% residue is precisely props + agents + HUD chrome standing in a black void.

   world.js / spacebg.js / terrain.js are browser-flow IIFEs with no module.exports (the
   world-setskin.test.js house pattern), so the wiring is SOURCE-LOCKED here and the pixel proof
   above is the live half. COMMENTS ARE STRIPPED BEFORE MATCHING — this file describes the very
   identifiers it asserts, and a test that passes on its own prose proves nothing. */
