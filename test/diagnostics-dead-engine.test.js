/* STARNET — the DEAD-ENGINE diagnostic fallback (2026-07-29).

   WHY THIS TEST EXISTS. A 0.7.0 user sat on "Can't reach StarNet's local service" for a day. All support ever
   received was a screenshot of that sentence — because the app's one self-service diagnostic door,
   "⧉ copy diagnostics for a bug report", fetched GET /api/diagnostics FROM THE SIDECAR. So in the exact failure
   the door is offered under, it returned nothing and the user had nothing to send. Worse, that one sentence
   cannot distinguish the two causes it might have, and they have OPPOSITE fixes:
       • the sidecar never started        -> restarting/reinstalling is right;
       • the model's reply stream dropped -> restarting is useless and the sidecar is fine.

   So the fallback report has exactly one job: make a non-technical user's paste say WHICH. These assertions pin
   that job — most importantly that an UNPROVEN probe is reported as unproven and never rendered as "down"
   (truthful telemetry: an inconclusive measurement must never be published as a conclusive one). */
