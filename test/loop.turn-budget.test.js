/* node test/loop.turn-budget.test.js — the PER-TURN aggregate tool-output budget.

   tools/registry.js caps each result on its own at 80k. That was sufficient while tool calls ran strictly one
   at a time: the model saw one big result and could narrow its NEXT call. Parallel batches deleted that
   feedback loop — N results land together, so N x 80k arrives in a single turn with no decision point in
   between, and a few wide greps blow the context window the loop was supposed to be reasoning inside.

   The shrink is WATER-FILLED rather than proportional, and that is the part worth pinning: a proportional cut
   punishes a 900-character result to make room for a 300k one, and the short result is usually the answer. */
