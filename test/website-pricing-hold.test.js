/* node test/website-pricing-hold.test.js — the paid tier is held back by TWO scripts, and until now
   nothing tested either of them.

   WHAT IS ACTUALLY AT STAKE. `pricing.html` is written, reviewed, and deliberately unpublished
   (Andrew, 2026-08-02), along with the Credits clauses in the legal pages. The only thing standing
   between that and starnetos.com is `scripts/stage-website-deploy.mjs`. If its guard silently stops
   guarding, the failure is invisible: Cloudflare's catch-all answers 200 for every path, so nothing
   404s and nobody notices that a paid tier was announced early — with legal text citing a price
   list, on a domain where the price list resolves to the homepage.

   The mirrored risk is the day it goes live: `scripts/go-live-credits.mjs` makes eighteen edits, and
   an edit whose anchor text has drifted since it was written would leave the site HALF-LAUNCHED.
   That has already happened once by hand (docs pages fixed, legal pages missed on the same pass).
   So this test does not check that the launch works — it checks that the script still RECOGNISES
   every file it claims to edit, today, in this branch. That is the thing that rots. */
