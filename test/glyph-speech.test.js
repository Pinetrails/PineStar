/* node test/glyph-speech.test.js — THE STATION'S OWN TONGUE (W6, 2026-08-16).

   THE ASK: "when the agents appear to interact with each other, a speech bubble pops up above
   their heads with language that can't be transcripted." W4/W5 already made two (or three) idle
   bodies meet, face each other and take turns mouthing. What was missing was the bubble.

   THE PROPERTY THAT MATTERS MOST IS THE UNREADABILITY, and it is not a joke — it is the honest
   register. A social beat is ambient station LIFE: no message crossed the bus, no run happened,
   nothing was said. A bubble carrying words would be the app asserting content the harness
   cannot prove, which is the one thing this product never does. A script that is not a language
   asserts only the true part: these two are talking, right now. So the rule this file exists to
   defend is that NOTHING ON THIS PATH IS TEXT — a rune is geometry, and if a later change ever
   swaps in characters (a font, a codepoint, a canned phrase list) this test goes red.

   world.js is a browser IIFE (can't require under node), so — exactly like talk-turn.test.js —
   this extracts the marked pure block from the SOURCE and executes it: the shipped alphabet is
   under test, not a copy of it.

   Contract under test:
     • the alphabet is pure geometry (no strings, no codepoints, nothing transcribable)
     • every stroke stays inside its own 4x6 cell (a glyph can never bleed onto its neighbour)
     • strokes are horizontal / vertical / true 45° only (anything else is fuzzy at 1px)
     • one seed ⇒ one phrase, always (a line holds still for the turn it is on screen)
     • different speakers/turns ⇒ different lines (it is not one canned string)
     • a speaker only ever draws runes from its OWN dialect, and dialects actually differ
     • phrase size is bounded, so the bubble it feeds cannot overflow
     • the WIRING: the line is rolled on the turn's rising edge, refuses the silent beat kinds,
       is cleared when the encounter ends, and never outranks a REAL spoken line */
