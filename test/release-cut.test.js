/* ---- THE CUT MUST CRYPTOGRAPHICALLY VERIFY ITS OWN SIGNATURE -------------------------------------
   release-cut checked only that a .sig file EXISTS and is newer than the installer. Neither says it was
   made with the right KEY. A cut with the wrong updater private key (a restored/regenerated
   ~/.tauri/starnet-updater.key, or STARNET_UPDATER_KEY_FILE pointing elsewhere) passed T1 signing, T5
   public-distribution and verify-update-host completely green, published, and then hard-failed the update
   for EVERY installed app — the exact failure minisign-verify.mjs exists to prevent, and whose own header
   names this gap. It was wired into ONE producer (release-assemble-manifest, the CI train + canary) and not
   into this one: the local one-command Windows cutter the launch checklist says to run LAST, right before
   upload. Nothing downstream catches it — t5 text-compares the manifest against the .sig, t1 checks
   existsSync + mtime, verify-update-host checks length > 40.

   The non-dry path runs a real desktop build, so this replays the exact check with REAL crypto and locks
   that the cutter performs it — and performs it BEFORE staging anything into release/. */
