/* rec-quality-live.mjs — LIVE proof for the recommendation QUALITY LOOP lane (throwaway verification driver).
   Boots a seeded SKYNET_DEV sidecar on its own port + its own scratch workspace, drives headless Chrome to
   the floor, then asserts against the REAL page (real modules, real stores, real DOM):

     1. Both halves are loaded and read the LIVE understanding/dossier state (no injected fakes).
     2. THE SCORER CHANGES A REAL OUTCOME: two REAL agent.run.end passes, the gentle-band field the pass itself
        stages captured each time, real outcomes folded through the store's own API in between — and the
        same-band winner moves off the one pure priority order would have named.
     3. The QUALITY WEIGHT reaches the live pass: Recommend.pick is wrapped, a real agent.run.end is emitted,
        and the candidates the REAL recommendPass hands the spine are inspected for their earned `quality`.
     4. The ATTRIBUTION STAMP lands on the spawned work's meta: an accepted offer is armed, a real run is
        driven through Chat.send, and Chat.runMeta(runId).rec is read back.
     5. The STALE-BELIEF RE-CONFIRM renders as a real card in COMMS, and DENY writes through the real stores
        (the belief is gone from the dossier, the question is fingerprint-denylisted).

     This slice used to hand Recommend.pick two hand-built candidates of the SAME kind. The pass can never emit
     that shape (one candidate per kind), so it proved nothing about the live product — and while it passed, the
     scorer was in fact INERT: every modifier was clamped under the per-kind tier gap, and no field the pass
     could actually produce ever ranked differently from pure priority order.

     apply REAL outcomes through the store's own API in between, and watch the same-band winner change. The first
