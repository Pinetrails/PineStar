/* sidecar/questsweeps.js — QUEST V2: the PURE matching half of the mechanical contract sweeps.

   quest-store.js owns completion (completeByContract / bindRun / stallRun) but is deliberately exact-key:
   it never decides WHICH keys a live seam just proved. That decision is seam-specific — "is this capability
   live", "does this committed memory cover that fact", "which quests should this run bind" — and this module
   holds it as pure, node-testable functions so sidecar/index.js only wires call sites (composition-root law).

   The four real seams (each caller passes questStore.openForAgent(agentId) — its own + station-wide quests):

     • run      — runBindIds(quests, agentId): the STATION QUESTS injection seam binds the live TASK run to the
                  agent's OWN open run-contract quests (bindRun), so the existing run-end settle hook — which
                  already calls completeByContract('run', runId) on 'done' and stallRun on any other reason —
                  can actually find them. Own quests ONLY (never station-wide): binding a station-wide quest to
                  whichever agent happens to run next would let an unrelated run "complete" it. This mirrors v1
                  workqueststore.onRunStart (the armed quest claimed the launched run); a station-wide run quest
                  is instead bound at the tool seam when an agent provably works it (quest.update op:"progress").

     • prop     — livePropKeys(quests, agentId, station, resolved): the run-admission seam is where the sidecar
                  PROVES a capability is live — resolveTools projects the placed office into real grants, fresh
                  every run. A prop key may name a placeable objectType (dish/cabinet/workbench/…), a capId
                  family (web/cabinet/workbench/…), a resolved tool name (covers live MCP connector tools), or
                  'compute'. There is no other server-side placement signal (the world/build lives in the
                  browser); a run carrying the grant IS the harness's proof the capability went live.

     • fact     — learnedFactKeys(quests, agentId, record): fires from writeMemoryRecord (sidecar/index.js), the
                  ONE server-side path that commits a memory record (silent auto-save + Keep/Edit turn-in). A
                  fact key matches when it IS the committed record's id, equals the committed content, or appears
                  verbatim inside it (normalized, ≥ MIN_FACT_KEY chars so 'a' can never match) — the durable
                  record is the proof the harness learned it. NOTE the dossier itself lives in the BROWSER
                  (localStorage; /api/study/resolve only reconciles stashes and does not carry the accepted
                  dimension), so there is no honest server-side dossier-write seam — the memory commit is the
                  closest real proof point, and dossier-dim keys simply stay open until a memory covers them.

     • artifact — artifactQuestKeys(quests, agentId): the run-end settle hook resolves each open artifact key
                  inside the CALLING agent's fs jail (fsJail.resolveInside — same proof /api/file uses) and
                  completes only when the file EXISTS on disk. This module only selects the candidates; the
                  existence check stays at the composition root (it needs the real fs + jail). Workshop/night-
                  shift builds ride the same runOnce host, so their manifests land under the same sweep.

   PURE: no fs / clock / rng / network (lint-determinism.js scans sidecar/). Every function is defensive about
   its inputs (junk quests/absent fields never throw) and re-checks visibility (open + own-or-station-wide)
   rather than trusting the caller's read. */
