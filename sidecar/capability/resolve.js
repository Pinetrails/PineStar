/* sidecar/capability/resolve.js — resolveTools: the PURE projection of placed objects onto
   the tools an agent may use THIS turn. Capability follows the agent's ASSIGNED room (the desk),
   not its body tile. room.capabilities is derived, never hand-stored. Called fresh every turn so
   placing/reclaiming an object changes the agent's reach on the very next model call.

   station = {
     rooms:  { <roomId>: { id, objects: [ { instanceId, objectType } ] } },
     agents: { <agentId>: { id, room: <roomId> } }
   }
   resolveTools(agentId, station, capRegistry?, opts?) ->
     { agentId, room, hasCompute, tools[], grants[], approvalRules{}, networkCaps{} }

   opts.disabledCaps: an object/Set of capIds the user has switched OFF in the TOOLSETS console (the
   toolset kill-switch layered on top of object=capability). A disabled family's grants are DROPPED here
   before they ever reach the tool gate. `compute` is NEVER filtered (the COMPUTE GATE freebie — disabling
   it would make the agent unable to think). MCP connector tools are projected separately by the caller and
   never pass through this map, so their own per-connector `enabled` flag stays authoritative. */
